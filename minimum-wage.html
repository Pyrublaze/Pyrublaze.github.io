<h2><u><strong><span style="font-size:16pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">Minimum Wage</span></span></strong></u></h2>

<p><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#FFFFFF"><strong><em>I am generally sympathetic to minimum wages as a means to help alleviate hardship amongst the poor. However, it is important to acknowledge the limitations that the minimum wage has. While in most places where it has been implemented it has had positive effects, if too high it can result in negative effects occurring, such as decreased employment and increased prices which outweigh the benefits of increased wages. Although the literature on the optimal minimum wage is scant, it appears that the best minimum wage is one that is indexed to around 59% of the median hourly wage within the particular jurisdiction. Otherwise, other poverty-reducing measures are ultimately better at increasing the quality of life of the poor, which would not have the potential of causing decreases in employment.</em></strong></span></span></span></p>

<h3><u><strong><span style="font-size:13.999999999999998pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#FFFFFF">Monopsony and Effects on Firms</span></span></span></strong></u></h3>

<p><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#FFFFFF"><strong>There are three schools of thought when it comes to the minimum wage debate. All of these emphasize the importance of the responses that firms have to minimum wage increases as a determinant of the actual effects of minimum wages. The major two, the competitive and monopsonistic model, are in opposition as to whether a minimum wage can meaningfully improve the lives of workers.&nbsp;</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#FFFFFF"><strong>The competitive model, which is commonly taught in basic economics courses, assumes as the name suggests that markets are perfectly competitive and always at an optimal equilibrium. A consequence of any minimum wage change will be higher unemployment and consequently an increased labor supply, due to firms being unable to afford a higher wage for their workers. This brings the market into disequilibrium and harms all parties involved.</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/PA701.pdf" style="text-decoration:none"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#FFFFFF"><u>The Negative Effects of Minimum Wage Laws</u></span></span></span></a></p>

<ul>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#FFFFFF">The basic competitive model of a minimum wage states that any minimum wage would reduce employment and cause an excess supply of labor. This excess supply is dispersed in the form of reduced hours, fewer job opportunities, and a shift in employment from sectors covered by the wage law to sectors not covered, including the underground economy.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#FFFFFF"><strong><em>There is some evidence that the competitive model accurately describes the situation with the minimum wage. Firm exit is one piece of evidence which provides support for this model. If firms exist in a competitive market in which each firm has zero or near zero profit, we would expect to see that minimum wage increases would result in firms leaving, particularly lower-quality firms closer to the margin of exit. Data has shown this to be accurate.</em></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/33111775/17-088.pdf;jsessionid=DFC2E1554F19FAD9B623717C22136BAC?sequence=1" style="text-decoration:none"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#FFFFFF"><u>Survival of the Fittest: The Impact of the Minimum Wage on Firm Exit</u></span></span></span></a></p>

<ul>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#FFFFFF"><em>&ldquo;The evidence suggests that higher minimum wages increase overall exit rates for restaurants. However, lower quality restaurants, which are already closer to the margin of exit, are disproportionately impacted by increases to the minimum wage. Our point estimates suggest that a one dollar increase in the minimum wage leads to a 14 percent increase in the likelihood of exit for a 3.5-star restaurant (which is the median rating), but has no discernible impact for a 5-star restaurant (on a 1 to 5 star scale).&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#FFFFFF"><strong>The second major model of the effects of a minimum wage on firm behavior is the monopsonistic or oligopsonistic model. Whereas a monopoly is a situation in which there is only one seller within a particular market, a monopsony is a situation in which there is only one buyer within a particular market. Firms are buyers within the labor market, and can thus theoretically operate as monopsonies. In the case of a monopsony, markets are not perfectly competitive, and firms have more market power. This means that they have an ability to set wages, and will deliberately avoid purchasing until the equilibrium level to hold down their own prices. Given that wages are deliberately set below the equilibrium level, those who subscribe to the monopsony model would assert that an effectively set minimum wage would enable the market price to equal the equilibrium price, ensuring that workers are paid more without increasing their levels of unemployment. Interestingly, the monopsony model actually predicts a small increase in employment as a consequence of an effectively set minimum wage, because it increases the supply of labor without preventing firms from purchasing that labor. Given that a monopsony is generally nonexistent in the real world, the term &ldquo;oligopsony&rdquo; is often used in the empirical literature to refer to a set of a few firms which generally operate in the same way as a monopsony does.</strong></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#FFFFFF">A monopsony is a market condition in which there is only one buyer. Because of their unique position, they have a wealth of power, being able to effectively set wages. This wage control drives down the cost to the employer and increases profit margins.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#FFFFFF">The monopsony model holds that markets are not perfectly competitive, and there are only a few employers in a particular marketplace. These firms have more market power than firms in competitive markets. This model predicts minimum wage increases to cause increases in employment.</span></span></span></li>

<ul>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#FFFFFF">Monopsony power results in economic efficiency, because the monopsonist avoids purchasing the last few units of a good whose value to the monopsonist is greater than their marginal cost, in order to hold down the price paid for prior units.</span></span></span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#FFFFFF">In principle, this can be mitigated by a well-placed legal price floor. However, if the price floor is too high, the monopsonist will reduce its purchases within the labor market and inefficiency occurs.</span></span></span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#FFFFFF">Oligopsony is a more real-world elaboration of the monopsony theory, in which employers hold power over wages if they are few in number. These small numbers can be a result of collusion if employers cooperate in setting wages, or from inflexibility of their respective workforces.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#FFFFFF"><strong><em>There is a fair amount of evidence that monopsonistic/oligopsonistic models have some merit to them as well. Some firms, such as those in the tomato market have been observed exhibiting oligopsonistic characteristics.&nbsp;</em></strong></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#FFFFFF"><em>&ldquo;The empirical results of this paper for the California processing tomato market are remarkably consistent with dominant-firm-price-leadership oligopsony. The results suggest that supply shifted exactly as one would expect with the tomato harvester displacing labor; this effect is statistically significant. Likewise, (perceived) demand became more inelastic; every estimated coefficient reflects a decrease in elasticity. Finally, prices and quantities have also behaved exactly as oligopsonistic theory suggests. Prices have fallen in every case (after removing the effect of exogenous forces), while qualitative impacts on quantities have been observed in both directions, rather than the single direction implied by competition.&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#FFFFFF"><strong><em>In terms of the effects of minimum wage on unemployment, there is a wide literature which all appears to disagree amongst itself about the effects of the minimum wage on unemployment. However, it generally suggests that there is a null or slightly negative effect of the minimum wage on employment. This is to some extent consistent with both competitive and monopsonistic models of the minimum wage, as the effects of minimum wages don&rsquo;t seem to go super hard either way. This could be due in part to the degrees to which different low-wage labor markets are competitive or monopsonistic.</em></strong></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#FFFFFF">All monopsony models suggest that a modest increase in legal minimum wages should increase employment. Early studies found decreases in employment as a consequence of the minimum wage. However, later studies found no effect on employment and a few found positive effects. However, the studies which suggest a positive effect are controversial and have not convinced the majority of labor economists. Regardless, the rate of exploitation, if positive, is probably small.</span></span></span></li>

<ul>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#FFFFFF">Institutional or behavioral models were often used for evaluating minimum wages up until the 1950s. They emphasize the rejection of a well-defined downward sloping demand curve, the face that labor markets are imperfectly competitive, and the fact that technological and psychosocial factors in firms and internal labor markets are determinants of cost and productivity. A key proposition is that moderate minimum wage increases may in the short-run have no employment effect or a positive employment effect, and that employers will respond by absorbing the cost impact through reducing sales, improving service, and general economic expansion. It also predicts that a higher minimum wage leads to a ripple effect in internal wage structure as firms raise the pay of above-minimum wage employees to maintain morale while also allowing for some internal wage compression among employees with higher seniority.</span></span></span></li>
