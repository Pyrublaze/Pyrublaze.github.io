<ul>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">The main advantage of affirmative action is that it increases the number of black students in law schools in general and also prestigious law schools. However, they are as a whole disadvantaged when affirmative action is in place, with lower GPAs and higher attrition.</span></span></span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">As a consequence, blacks are less likely than whites to pass state bar exams after multiple attempts. However, when they do pass the bar, they have a slight earning advantage than whites seeking similar jobs with similar credentials likely due to racial preferences in hiring.</span></span></span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">When taking into account the negative effects of affirmative action on graduation and passing the bar, affirmative action probably tends to decrease the number of new black lawyers.</span></span></span></li>

</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><strong><em>Unfortunately, this study has the problem of presupposing in their regression models that the effect of GPA and SAT performance is uniform for races. When not looking at average effects, a different picture is painted in which prior performance is less of a predictor of future performance for black people. Moreover, the effect of school selectivity on performance is negative for the general population, but looking specifically at black people it positively predicts performance.</em></strong></span></span></span></p>
