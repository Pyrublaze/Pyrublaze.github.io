<h2><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:16pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><strong>Police Use of Force Bias</strong></span></span></span></h2>

<p><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><strong><em>The research on police use of force bias is all over the place, and this could be due to variation in research methods or variation in the actual phenomenon studied. Needless to say, the evidence is not 100% clear. Despite all of this, in my assessment, there is no disparity in police use of force conditional upon encounter. There does appear to be a disparity in police use of force once the initial probability of an encounter is taken into account. That is to say, police are not more likely to shoot a black person in a police encounter compared to a white person. However, once taking into account the probability of a police encounter occurring, there is a disparity.</em></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><strong><em>This disparity disappears though when controlling for crime rates, suggesting it is due to differences in crime as opposed to systemic racism on the part of the police. Additionally, there is no strong evidence that officer race has an effect on use of force bias also suggesting this is not evidence of racism.</em></strong></span></span></span></p>

	<ul>
		<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><em>&ldquo;The first requirement is that studies must have been published between 1995 and 2013.&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></li>
		<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><em>&ldquo;Second, only studies that included patrol officers as the sample under study were used.&rdquo; </em></span></span><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">(As opposed to detectives)</span></span></span></li>
		<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><em>&ldquo;Third, sufficient statistical information was needed to allow for the calculation of an effect size.&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></li>
		<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><em>&ldquo;Fourth, studies that measured use of force through a &ldquo;force factor&rdquo; were excluded. These measures incorporate suspect resistance into the dependent variable and are thus substantively different from the focus of this study. This is not a judgment of whether use of force research should include suspect as an independent variable or within the dependent variable, but it is a judgment that including these studies would contribute to the potential violation of the homogeneity assumption of meta-analyses. Furthermore, including force factor studies would introduce an independent variable of the present analysis as part of the dependent variable. Doing so would render the present analysis non-recursive.&ldquo;</em></span></span></span></li>
		<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><em>&ldquo;Fifth, the collected data must have been at the micro level&mdash;data collected at the encounter or suspect level. Only those studies that recorded officer decisions during encounters with citizens were included. Studies that were excluded due to this requirement measured use of force in a variety of manners; including hypothetical vignettes, citizen attitudes regarding use of force decisions, and simulated training environments. All of these are conceptually distinct from decisions made in the field.&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></li>
		<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><em>&ldquo;Sixth, studies that included a sample where all encounters involved use of force were excluded. Much of the same logic applied for excluding force factor studies also applies here. Studies that only include encounters where force was used by an officer are distinct from studies that include all encounters between officers and citizens. This truncates the dependent variable, and including these studies would again inflate heterogeneity issues.&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></li>
		<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><em>&ldquo;Seventh, only multivariate tests were included to reduce the chance of including studies that may be misspecified. If a study only included a single explanatory variable, there is a substantial chance that the finding is spurious.

		<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><em>&ldquo;Nineteen studies met all of these criteria.&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></li>

In a typical study, a researcher will start with a previously defined population where each individual is at risk of a particular outcome. For instance, a population of drivers stopped by police can have one of two outcomes: they can be arrested, or they can be sent on their way. Instead of following this standard approach, Fryer constructs a fictitious population of people who are shot by police and people who are arrested.
