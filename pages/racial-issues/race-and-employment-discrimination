There is some evidence for this hypothesis being true, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to account for all of the discrimination observed. Covariates such as the inclusion of a criminal record don&rsquo;t appear to substantially affect the results, which one would expect to decrease the disparity if the statistical discrimination hypothesis was true. Some data which looks at variations in resume quality and increases in data in general also reveal a similar pattern, although this is contradicted by other evidence. This suggests there may be some statistical discrimination at play but it does not account for the totality of the explanation for the hiring gap.</strong></span></span></span></p>

If the main reason employers discriminate is statistical, employers should be less likely to rely on group stereotypes in drawing conclusions about applicants as their information about an individual applicant increases. In interviews, employers receive additional information regarding (at least) the dress, appearance and demeanor of applicants. Yet we find as much discrimination or more from interview to job offer as from application to callback, suggesting that the extra interview information is not significantly counter-acting employer biases.&quot;</em></span></span></span></li>

<p><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><strong>It has been demonstrated that if the effect of improved productivity signals or resumes to employers on hiring is nonlinear, certain ways in which unobserved skills can be distributed between two populations can result in discrimination being shown in studies when it doesn&rsquo;t exist.

If it isn&rsquo;t, and there are differences in the variance of productivity between blacks and whites, even assuming the same mean productivity level, then the cutoff might favor blacks or whites even if mean productivity is the same. Given that mean productivity is held constant in correspondence testing studies, it is possible to see differences in callbacks between the two groups even when there is no actual bias at play, and it is impossible to rule this out as a possibility.</span></span></span></li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><strong>However, the actual influence this has on the results of audit studies must be very large, as evidence has suggested that with identical resumes, a black applicant without a criminal record is less likely to be called back for a job interview than a white applicant with a criminal record, in spite of the fact that a criminal record has a drastic effect on a person&rsquo;s probability of being employed. Because such an effect must be very large, without evidence in favor of an effect even being real it seems reasonable to assume that it likely at least does not eliminate all of the discrimination that is observed in the studies presented above.</strong></span></span></span></p>
