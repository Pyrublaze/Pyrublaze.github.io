<h1>Misconduct, Mistakes, and Retractions in Academia</h1>

<div class="subinfo">
<table>
<td>
<p>
    <b>Misconduct, mistakes, and retractions are common within academia, although getting precise estimates for its prevalence is difficult. Misconduct appears to be rising significantly, although it is not clear whether this is due to improved screening practices or changes in the number of publications which have research containing misconduct. Higher journal impact factor is positively associated with misconduct as well, although again it is not clear whether this is a screening issue or a publication quality issue. Much of this fraud appears to be deliberately done. Luckily, retractions which occur as a consequence of misconduct result in the author of the publication getting fewer citations in the future, suggesting there is a degree of self-correction which occurs in academia dealing with this. There are a variety of reasons why misconduct occurs. Much of this research suggests that academia can be fallible in this domain.</b>

<h2>Political Leanings of Academics</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Academics lean overwhelmingly left today, although in the past it has been more balanced. This is partially due to differences in intelligence and openness to experience, although this cannot explain all of it. Part of it is also due to self-selection, a hostile climate for right-wingers, and discrimination of right-wingers. Viewpoint diversity promotes creativity, discovery, and problem-solving, while viewpoint homogeneity promotes confirmation bias and conformity, so having more of a balance of viewpoints will help progress social science. However, it does not appear that this will affect the political orientation of students, who&rsquo;s political ideology doesn&rsquo;t change with faculty ideology and instead reflects trends of the broader population in their age group.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Left skew of academia cannot be primarily explained by intelligence, although may be partly explained by openness to experience</li>
    <li>There are some other notable and plausible explanations:<ul>
            <li>Typing of academia as left-leaning, which pushes non-leftists out of academia</li>
            <li>Pressures to conform to the prevailing ideology</li>
            <li>Non-conformity on the part of academics going against the reality that they are paid less than those of their intelligence level in other areas</li>
            <li>There is evidence that left-leaning academics are willing to discriminate against conservatives and that conservatives which are in academia are significantly more cited and productive than their leftist counterparts, suggesting that they are held to a higher standard.</li>

<p><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/qpn57/" style="text-decoration:none;">Political Bias in the Social Sciences: A Critical, Theoretical, and Empirical Review</a></p>
<ul>
    <li>Literature review</li>
    <li>There is an overwhelmingly left skew in academia</li>
    <li>Political bias of researchers is not necessarily bad when it is counterbalanced by differing political views of different researchers, but when there is an overwhelming skew in one direction it can produce biased results</li>
    <li>It is not clear what the threshold for ideological diversity is to ensure Mertonian skepticism, although wherever that line is it is clear it has been passed</li>
    <li>One significant argument that normal academic processes protect political biases is that political leaning of an article has no relationship with its replicability</li>
    <li>However, education and scientific literacy increase polarization on controversial science topics presumably because people look for evidence that bolsters what they already believe</li>
    <li>Moreover, there are a wide variety of issues identified in the social sciences, including the replication crisis.</li>
    <li>Peer review is also unreliable, it does not insure against poor or biased science</li>
    <li>Merton&rsquo;s norms of science may be touted, although it&rsquo;s not obvious that they&rsquo;re actually practiced. For example, the fusion of activism with scientific investigation and the statement that certain publications are &ldquo;harmful&rdquo; violates the disinterestedness norm</li>
    <li>Universalism is violated when &ldquo;lived experiences&rdquo; of minority groups are given precedence</li>
    <li>The study on political leaning and replicability ignores how political bias isn&rsquo;t argued to be in that domain, but rather in methods, interpretation, citation, and canonization</li>
    <li>Authors of this review believe the conclusion of the study is probably valid, but the study is too biased to actually demonstrate it, for a variety of reasons discussed</li>
    <li>This paper presents two complimentary models on political bias in academia:</li>
    <li>Pipeline - Left-leaning activists select into academia and make the space more hostile to non-leftists, purging those with different views.&nbsp;<ul>
            <li>Research suggests many academics endorse discriminating against their political opponents, which can contribute to this.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Disproportionate faculty awards go to those on the left, even controlling for achievements, primarily publications.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Targeting sanctions initiated by scholars and graduate students are overwhelmingly initiated by the left.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Many academics openly declate hostility to conservatives.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Thus, the belief among conservative professors that leaking their politics risks harming their careers is likely correct.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Left-wing authoritarianism is psychologically characterized by three things: intolerance, censorship, and aggression, all directed at one&rsquo;s political opponents</li>
            <li>This can manifest as social vigilanteism</li>
            <li>Given that academia is overwhelmingly left-leaning, it is likely that this is relatively prevalent in academia even if high scores of left-wing authoritarianism are uncommon in the general population.</li>
            <li>Success in academia depends on approval from others, meaning that left-wing academia can be self-perpetuating</li>
            <li>If the social sciences are dominated by a left-leaning bias, it can appear much more objective than it actually is to an outsider</li>
            <li>Therefore, even when hundreds of studies say the same thing, because of the erosion of Mertonian norms it can still fail to justify the conclusion those studies reach</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Wheel model - Political bias manifests in the scientific enterprise to undercut validity and credibility<ul>
            <li>This is done through manipulation of questions asked, measurement, interpretations, what gets cited, canonization, suppression, and discrimination</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>It does not seem likely that anything can meaningfully be done about all of this, as many major professional psychology organizations appear to support activism at this point in time</li>

<h2>Replicability in Science</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There exists a replicability crisis in science, particularly in the social sciences. Still, replicability varies between subsets of the social sciences. The degree to which a publication or finding is replicable can in fact be predicted well by scientists, but are published by journals because they are more interesting. Journal prestige in fact is negatively correlated to replicability. This appears to be due to intense competition and time pressure.</p>

    <li>Finds that statisticians are not immune to misinterpretations of null hypothesis significance tests, and it is hard to conceive of consensus among statisticians due to this</li>
    <li>Beyond this, problems can be seen in the misuses of judgmental adjustments that try to overcome the inherent shortcomings of null hypothesis significance tests.</li>
