The major causal criteria of temporality, biological plausibility, consistency and lack of alternative explanations are well supported. Of the small minority of studies which find no association, most can be explained by income inequality being measured at an inappropriate scale, the inclusion of mediating variables as controls, the use of subjective rather than objective measures of health, or follow up periods which are too short. The evidence that large income differences have damaging health and social consequences is strong and in most countries inequality is increasing. Narrowing the gap will improve the health and wellbeing of populations.&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></li>

<p><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><strong><em>Firstly, inequality can be argued to be an important cause of poverty, given that the more unequally distributed wealth is, the more people will have relatively low income and be pushed towards a poverty threshold, regardless of how poverty is defined.&nbsp;</em></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><strong><em>Secondly, I would suggest that negative attitudes towards inequality are going to be to some extent a natural part of human nature. Humans are inherently social animals who care about their position in hierarchies relative to others. Therefore, there is going to be some level of negative attitudes towards inequality in any human society where inequality is present so even if this entirely covaries with crime, it&rsquo;s not something which can be changed and so doesn&rsquo;t undermine the relationship between inequality and crime.</em></strong></span></span></span></p>
