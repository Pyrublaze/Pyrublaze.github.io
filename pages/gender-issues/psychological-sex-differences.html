<ul>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><em>&ldquo;Replicating previous findings, women reported higher Big Five Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism scores than men. However, more extensive gender differences were found at the level of the aspects, with significant gender differences appearing in both aspects of every Big Five trait. For Extraversion, Openness, and Conscientiousness, the gender differences were found to diverge at the aspect level, rendering them either small or undetectable at the Big Five level.&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><em>&ldquo;Women scored higher than men on Enthusiasm, Compassion, Politeness, Orderliness, Volatility, Withdrawal, and Openness. Men scored higher than women on Assertiveness and Intellect. This indicates that the two aspects of Extraversion (Enthusiasm and Assertiveness) and the two aspects of Openness/Intellect display gender differences in opposite directions. Such divergence in gender differences at the aspect level helps to elucidate the small effect of the gender difference in overall Extraversion and the lack of a significant gender difference in Openness/Intellect.&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><em>&ldquo;Although Intellect includes perceptions of cognitive ability and is more strongly associated with IQ scores than Openness (DeYoung et al., submitted), the fact that men score higher than women in Intellect should not be taken as indicative of greater intelligence for men than women. Gender differences in general intelligence are negligible, although men are typically found to show more variance in scores than women (Deary et al., 2007; van der Sluis et al., 2008). However, our findings are consistent with the finding that men show higher self-estimates of intelligence than women, across cultures (von Stumm et al., 2009). This pattern has been described as one of male hubris and female humility in relation to intelligence. The gender difference in Intellect probably reflects these biases related to confidence in intellectual abilities.&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></li>

<p><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><strong><em>I&rsquo;m fairly interested in investigating the degree to which these differences are a result of biology as opposed to socialization. I would first point out that such differences are extremely large, which means that any social force which 100% accounts for sex differences in personality must also be extremely large to push men and women into certain personality traits.</em></strong></span></span></span></p>

We found a global effect size D = 2.71, corresponding to an overlap of only 10% between the male and female distributions. Even excluding the factor showing the largest univariate ES, the global effect size was D = 1.71 (24% overlap).

<p><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="background-color:#ffffff"><strong><em>These differences do not vary significantly by age, and are more pronounced as cultures become more egalitarian. There are a wide variety of explanations for this precise finding, with a lot of research consistent or inconsistent with any given theory. However, if it is the case that there are at least some sex differences in personality across all cultures, and these are all in the same direction of men scoring higher or lower on a given measure in each culture, it seems fair to suggest that socializing factors cannot fully explain these differences in personality.</em></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><em>&ldquo;Overall, across age-groups 19&ndash;69 years old, women scored notably higher than men in Agreeableness (d = 0.58) and Neuroticism (d = 0.40). Specifically, women scored d &gt; 0.50 in facet traits Anxiety, Vulnerability, Openness to Emotions, Altruism, and Sympathy, while men only scored slightly higher (d &gt; 0.20) than women in facet traits Excitement-seeking and Openness to Intellect.

	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><em>&ldquo;Interestingly, Neuroticism was, unlike Agreeableness, not uniformly different between sexes across the age-spans, with the largest gap found in the late teens, narrowing and stabilizing first at around 45 years of age. According to a broad evolutionary perspective, this trend seems to coincide with female sexual fertility. In this phase of life, females tend to be more vulnerable than males, in regard to the heightened male sexual aggression (Archer, 2004), while simultaneously investing in pregnancy and caring for infants (Wood &amp; Eagly, 2002). Having women more disposed to anxiety (and empathy), while men are more disposed to assertiveness, may have been an optimal strategy for the propagation of the human species. Certainly, part of the sex gap could also be explained by cultural factors, such as young men not admitting to questionnaire-items assessing neuroticism. However, this explanation may not be supported by other-reports and behavioral observation (Vianello et al., 2013).&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></li>

Contrary to predictions from the social role model, gender differences were most pronounced in European and American cultures in which traditional sex roles are minimized.&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><em>&ldquo;Analyses of cultural variation in gender differences showed that differentiation is both reliable and general.

	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><em>&ldquo;That fact makes some explanations unlikely. Differences across cultures in the frequency of psychiatric diagnoses might be due to differential access to healthcare (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1987), but that could not easily explain differences in A. Yet the same cultures that find little difference between the sexes in N also find little difference in A, and in composites of facets from E and O. Somebroader explanation seems to be needed&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><em>&ldquo;One possible explanation is that these results are artifactual.Perhaps in traditional cultures, where clear sex role differences are prescribed, self-descriptions are based on comparisons of the self </em></span></span><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><em> </em></span></span><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><em>with others of the same gender.&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></li>

	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><em>&ldquo;Another possibility is that personality traits in general are less relevant to members of collectivist cultures (Cross &amp; Markus,1999), and thus relatively subtle gender differences may simply not be noticed. Church and Katigbak (2000), however, in their review of trait psychology in one collectivist culture, the Philip-pines, disputed that claim. Observer-rating data, particularly from observers outside the culture, might help resolve this issue.&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></li>

	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><em>&ldquo;A final, and perhaps most plausible, explanation relies on attri-bution processes (Weiner, 1990). In individualistic, egalitarian countries, an act of kindness by a woman may be perceived (by her and others) as a free choice that must reflect on her personality.The same act by a woman in a collectivistic, traditional country might be dismissed as mere compliance with sex role norms. Thus,real differences in behavior might be seen everywhere, but would be attributed to roles rather than traits in traditional cultures.&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></li>
