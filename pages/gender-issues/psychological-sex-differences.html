However, more extensive gender differences were found at the level of the aspects, with significant gender differences appearing in both aspects of every Big Five trait. For Extraversion, Openness, and Conscientiousness, the gender differences were found to diverge at the aspect level, rendering them either small or undetectable at the Big Five level.&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></li>

This indicates that the two aspects of Extraversion (Enthusiasm and Assertiveness) and the two aspects of Openness/Intellect display gender differences in opposite directions. Such divergence in gender differences at the aspect level helps to elucidate the small effect of the gender difference in overall Extraversion and the lack of a significant gender difference in Openness/Intellect.&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></li>

Gender differences in general intelligence are negligible, although men are typically found to show more variance in scores than women (Deary et al., 2007; van der Sluis et al., 2008). However, our findings are consistent with the finding that men show higher self-estimates of intelligence than women, across cultures (von Stumm et al., 2009). This pattern has been described as one of male hubris and female humility in relation to intelligence. The gender difference in Intellect probably reflects these biases related to confidence in intellectual abilities.&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></li>

According to a broad evolutionary perspective, this trend seems to coincide with female sexual fertility. In this phase of life, females tend to be more vulnerable than males, in regard to the heightened male sexual aggression (Archer, 2004), while simultaneously investing in pregnancy and caring for infants (Wood &amp; Eagly, 2002). Having women more disposed to anxiety (and empathy), while men are more disposed to assertiveness, may have been an optimal strategy for the propagation of the human species. Certainly, part of the sex gap could also be explained by cultural factors, such as young men not admitting to questionnaire-items assessing neuroticism. However, this explanation may not be supported by other-reports and behavioral observation (Vianello et al., 2013).&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></li>

In individualistic, egalitarian countries, an act of kindness by a woman may be perceived (by her and others) as a free choice that must reflect on her personality.The same act by a woman in a collectivistic, traditional country might be dismissed as mere compliance with sex role norms. Thus,real differences in behavior might be seen everywhere, but would be attributed to roles rather than traits in traditional cultures.&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></li>
