<p><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><strong><em>Detransition and regret following a gender transition are related but distinct concepts. However, they are often studied alongside each other. Instances of regret and detransition following sex reassignment surgery exist, but research has generally found it to be very rare. Data varies, but the vast majority of research identified in reviewing the literature as well as meta-analysis suggests that the rates of either are less than 5%.</em></strong></span></span></span></p>
