<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><strong><em>I am generally for a gender quota in political office, to help increase representation of women to be more proportional to men than is the case currently in most if not all political offices. Quotas have neutral to positive effects on the quality of politicians, and they normalize women getting into politics.</em></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><strong><em>Gender quotas can take several forms. They can be reserved seats in political office, they can be quotas for candidates on ballots, or they can be voluntary quotas for candidates in political parties.</em></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">The core idea behind gender quotas in politics is to ensure representation of women in politics. There are three major ways in which this is done:</span></span></span>

	<ul>
		<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">Reserved seats (constitutional and/or legislative)</span></span></span></li>
		<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">Legal candidate quotas (constitutional and/or legislative)</span></span></span></li>
		<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">Political party quotas (voluntary)</span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">These can ensure women make up 20, 30, 40, or 50% of the body in question</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><strong><em>These quotas increase the representation of women within politics.</em></strong></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><em>&ldquo;My results show that quotas that require more women to be on party ballots lead to the election of more women, independent of placement mandates and enforcement mechanisms, but rules governing where female candidates are listed on the ballot and sanctions for noncompliance amplify that effect. Candidate quotas can increase women&#39;s representation, but the quotas&#39; effectiveness depends on their design.&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><strong><em>Under such quota systems, the experience and decision-making ability of the candidates, primarily in terms of education, is the same if not better. This is because mediocre male politicians are pushed out of offices as a result of quotas.</em></strong></span></span></span></p>

	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><em>&ldquo;The statistical data suggests that, on the vast majority of measures, quota women do not differ significantly from other MPs. Indeed, on some indicators they appear to be better prepared for office than non-quota legislators. The evidence thus demonstrates that quotas have not advanced women that are less qualified or more elite than other MPs.&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></li>

Once women are elected, the volume of activity shows no evidence of being gendered, suggesting that women are as effective in the job as men. These findings imply that sex is a barrier to entry but not to performance, reinforcing claims for the use of quotas to overcome entry barriers and negating claims that quotas produce second-rate parliamentarians.&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></li>

This effect is due not only to the higher number of elected women, who are on average more educated than men, but also to the lower number of low-educated elected men. The positive effect on quality is confirmed when we measure the latter with alternative indicators, it persists in the long run and it is robust to controlling for political ideology and political competition.&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><strong><em>Gender quotas help to normalize women in politics, having a cultural effect separate from the policy itself, helping to get more women into office through increasing the interest of potential female candidates and increasing the number of people who vote for female candidates.</em></strong></span></span></span></p>

Specifically, female legislators will place higher priority than male legislators on women&#39;s issues and children/family concerns, but their attitudes in other areas, such as education, health, the economy, agriculture, and employment, will be similar. However, I expect that gender dynamics in the legislative arena lead to marginalization of women such that gender differences will emerge for bill initiation behavior where they did not appear for attitudes. I test this using a survey of legislators&#39; issue preferences and archival data on the bills that legislators sponsor and find statistical support for the hypotheses.&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></li>
