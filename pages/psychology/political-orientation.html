<ul>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">Ideological differences in depression are significantly greater than gender differences.</span></span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">This gap has consistently remained across decades</span></span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">Conservatives have better sex lives than liberals</span></span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">The ideology gap in mental illness remains significant even after controlling for religious attendance</span></span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">Liberals are far more likely to be depressed, anxious, or otherwise neurotic compared to conservatives, and are roughly twice as likely as conservatives to report being diagnosed with a mental illness</span></span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">Both political ideology and psychological dispositions and disorders are heritable, so it could be that this link derives from shared genetic links, or it could be due to the adoption of either ideology causing one to have better or worse mental health</span></span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">There is evidence that children who are maladjusted (angry, aggressive, or otherwise antisocial) are more likely to align themselves with left-wing parties. Those who experienced abuse, insecurity, and trauma as children are also much more likely to identify as liberal.</span></span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">People who score highly on dark triad characteristics may be especially likely to gravitate towards certain strands of social justice ideology and authoritarianism, although some right-aligned ideology and social movements also attract some people. It appears that due to this these people tend to simply gravitate to areas where they can enhance themselves or exert influence, which seems more common in cultural left views which are more institutionalized.</span></span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">In more liberal countries, and more liberal regions within countries, there are higher rates of mental disorders</span></span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">Those who are right-wing and religious tend to give most frequently, give the highest shares of their income, and donate specifically to causes to alleviate human poverty and suffering</span></span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">However, liberals have more moral concern and tend to feel higher levels of empathy.</span></span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">Liberals tend to be less emotionally stable, and are far more likely to prize emotionality and to dwell on their emotions</span></span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">Liberals have more politically homogenous communities and social networks, and are far more willing to avoid, break off, or curb relationships over political differences, which is unlikely to enhance one&rsquo;s happiness or well-being</span></span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">One argument is that leftists are more likely to report being mentally ill because their spaces have a culture surrounding seeking out help even when problems are mild</span></span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">Liberals are more anxious about interactions across difference, and their perceptions, judgements and behaviors change dramatically depending on the demographic characteristics of the people they are engaging with or referring to, while conservatives are generally consistent</span></span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">Heightened perceptions of bias and discrimination are associated with mental anguish, social strain, and adverse physical outcomes, and liberal ideology is associated with heightened perceptions of bias and discrimination</span></span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">Among racial and ethnic minorities, perceptions of discrimination correlate strongly with educational attainment, which itself strongly informs ideological lean, which means that socioeconomic status has diminishing mental health returns for minorities</span></span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">Research suggests that the challenges of dealing with white liberal peers and their neuroses and dispositions may be a key source of burnout for minorities in progressive spaces</span></span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">It&rsquo;s been argued that many strains of liberal ideology function in practice as a form of reverse cognitive behavioral therapy</span></span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">However, none of this tells us about the truth of liberalism or conservatism. Arguably, deep commitment to &ldquo;the facts&rdquo; may be an impediment to flourishing</span></span></li>
