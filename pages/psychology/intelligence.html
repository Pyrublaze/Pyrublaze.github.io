Criminal offending was measured with nine different indicators from official records and intelligence was measured using three subscales (verbal, mathematical, and spatial reasoning) as well as a composite measure.

A large body of previous research has suggested that criminal offending is a group activity that occurs in the context of peer associations and other social interaction (Warr, 2002). It is possible that relative social isolation prevents individuals with intellectual disabilities from participating in crime as much as they would in the absence of the environmental constraints related to their disability.
