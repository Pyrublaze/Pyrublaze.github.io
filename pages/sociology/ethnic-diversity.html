<h2><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:16pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><strong><u>Ethnic Diversity</u></strong></span></span></span></h2>

<p><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><strong><em>I have generally concluded that ethnic diversity tends to produce negative effects for society as a whole. In particular, it lowers social trust and altruism, and increases conflict and poverty, as well as having negative effects on population health and economic growth. It seems much of this is due to people&rsquo;s biases towards their own in-group, which results in more diverse communities having less social cohesion. These effects are most strongly seen in poor and unequal societies which have weaker institutions, and these effects can be substantially reduced, nullified or even reversed in contexts of high economic development, economic egalitarianism, and strong institutions. Because of this, ethnic diversity should primarily be a cause of concern for developing countries and relatively unequal developed countries. It seems justifiable that in the context of developing countries, sometimes splits in countries due to ethnic divides are justifiable as a means to separate groups which may engage in high levels of conflict when put together.&nbsp;</em></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><strong><em>I have also concluded that much of the positive benefits of diversity in workplaces proclaimed by people are instead primarily a function of educational and viewpoint diversity rather than ethnic diversity itself. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that attempts to increase diversity in workplaces are inherently bad, but that such attempts should be at best regarded as forms of statistical discrimination by which to search for factors extrinsic to ethnic diversity itself.</em></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><strong><em>The overall research suggests that ethnic diversity has negative effects on social trust, based on results from both meta-analytical and experimental data and also a literature review on the subject.

	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">Some theorize that ethnic diversity would erode social trust because the mere exposure to different ethnic groups causes decreases in trust, as similarity is an indicator of shared norms and other behavior-regulating features relevant for trust.</span></span></span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">Some theories extend these ideas into notions of intergroup competition which explain reductions in social trust when there is ethnic diversity.</span></span></span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">It has also been argued by Robert Putnam that ethnic diversity leads to more social isolation and a &ldquo;hunkering down&rdquo;, which can reduce social trust.</span></span></span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">Some argue for contact theory, which suggests that while exposure to different ethnic groups could have negative effects on social trust, social contact such as conversations can increase social trust through the reduction of erroneous stereotypes.</span></span></span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">One critique of the ethnic diversity and social trust relationship is that ethnic diversity may be a proxy for social disadvantage and associated characteristics such as crime, which may drive a decline in social trust.

Most studies report a negative relationship centered around the reported overall meta-estimate. In most, but far from all, cases, the negative estimates are significantly different from zero. A smaller number of studies report positive relationships, but only a few of the positive study-pooled estimates are significantly different from zero. Notably, the study with the highest positive estimate is based on a rather idiosyncratic sample, namely Marschall &amp; Stolle&#39;s (2004) study of racial context and generalized social trust in Detroit in the 1970s. Overall, this indicates that ethnic diversity in residential settings does not lead to contact effects under general circumstances.&quot;</em></span></span></span></li>

	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><em>&ldquo;Concurrently, interethnic contact increases with larger out-group sizes for both minority and majority populations.

	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><em>&quot;The level of segregation is not the only likely moderator of the heterogeneity effect. The more members of ethnic out-groups are conceived to be different, the more they will be regarded as a threat to the dominant culture, and the more uncertain residents will be in how to interact with them. Hence, ethnic heterogeneity may be especially harmful if ethnic cleavages are deep, such as when they are cemented by an overlap with other socioeconomic cleavages. Concurrently, interethnic contact between groups of differing status will reduce prejudice and increase interethnic trust less than contact between equal status groups. Admittedly, ethnic inequality may not only catalyze heterogeneity effects but also dampen them.&quot;</em></span></span></span></li>

Consequently, there are no less than four possible effects that have to do with ethnicity: (a) the ethnicity of ego, (b) the ethnicity of alter, (c) the ethnic combination of the dyad constituted by ego-alter (which is mixed or homogeneous), and (d ) the ethnic composition of the locality in which ego and alter are situated. Only the fourth is theoretically linked to the constrict claim; the other three basically indicate composition effects. The studies in our review cover only the first (ethnicity of ego) and the fourth (ethnic composition of the locality) effect. Yet in ethnically diverse localities, one&rsquo;s neighbors are more likely to have a different ethnic background. Because to date studies have ignored the ethnicity of neighbors and the degree of overlap in neighbors&rsquo; ethnic backgrounds, and thereby the homophily principle, the studies we considered were biased toward finding negative effects of ethnic diversity on intraneighborhood social cohesion.&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></li>
