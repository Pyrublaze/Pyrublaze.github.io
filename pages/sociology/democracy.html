However, there is a lot of debate about the causal direction, if there is a causal relationship at all. I would need to examine this question further to form a stronger opinion on it, although a lot of the mechanisms discussed below in studies for how democracy causes economic growth seem intuitively correct to me. It is clear that while the precise economic effects of democracy have not been determined, it is very unlikely that democracy has negative effects on economic growth. In order to even begin to establish such a relationship, it would first need to be shown that there was a negative correlation between democracy and economic growth, and the existing evidence suggests the exact reverse.</em></strong></span></span></span></p>

Using traditional meta-analysis estimators, the bootstrap, and Fixed and Random Effects meta-regression models, it derives several robust conclusions. Taking all the available published evidence together, it concludes that democracy does not have a direct impact on economic growth. However, democracy has robust, significant, and positive indirect effects through higher human capital, lower inflation, lower political instability, and higher levels of economic freedom. Democracies may also be associated with larger governments and less free international trade. There also appear to be country- and region-specific democracy-growth effects. Overall, democracy&#39;s net effect on the economy does not seem to be detrimental.&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></li>

When we disentangle what components of democracy matter the most for growth, we find that civil liberties are what seem to be the most important. We also find positive effects of democracy on economic reforms, private investment, the size and capacity of government, and a reduction in social conflict. Clearly all of these are channels by which democracy can increase economic growth, and a great deal of further research is needed. Together with our previous work showing that democracy had no effect on inequality, these results suggest the interaction between democratic institutions and the level and distribution of income is more complex than the previous literature suggests.&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></li>

The second finding, stemming from Przeworski &amp; Limongi (1997), is that once we use a dichotomous definition of democracy and distinguish movements toward democracy from movements toward dictatorships, we find that income per capita does not cause democratization, but it does lead democracies to become consolidated (reduces the probability that a country will experience a coup).&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></li>
