As a result, the majority of South African women continued to terminate pregnancies through unsafe means, leading to annual unsafe abortions estimates of 120,000-250,000 during the 1975-1996 period [37&ndash;39]. By 1994, unsafe abortions had become a long-standing and significant threat to women&#39;s health in South Africa [38].&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></li>

The abortion care program and systematic shifts in reproductive health provision was followed by notable declines in abortion-related mortality. Figure 3 shows a decrease in abortion-related deaths in the period following the CTOP. In 1994, complications from unsafe abortion led to 32.69 deaths per 1,000 abortions. By 1998, only 0.80 deaths per 1,000 were reported and this number remained steady or dropped in subsequent years. Furthermore, as compared to 1994, there was a 91% drop in deaths related to unsafe abortion in the 1998-2001 period [58]. By the 2005-2007 period, annual abortion-related deaths accounted for only 3.3% of all maternal deaths [59].&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></li>
